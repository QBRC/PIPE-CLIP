**About**

Mammalian RNA is regulated through interactions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target transcripts. UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation combining high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) is able to profile genome-wide RBP-binding regions accurately and efficiently. Here we present PIPECLIP, a web tool which provides a pipeline for both bioinformaticians and biologist to identify the most likely cross-linking sites from PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP sequencing data.

**Note**
Demo data for PIPECLIP analysis available under Shared Data(Libraries). Please import into history for sample test run. More details available in the PipeClip Galaxy Manual.

**Parameters**

*Input*

SAM file from any mapping tool. Make sure the SAM file contains its header, otherwise an error will occur.

*CLIP type*

 - HITS-CLIP: Deletions, insertions and substitutions will be analyzed separately.
 - PAR-CLIP (4SU): Only T->C substitution will be analyzed.
 - PAR-CLIP (6SG): Only G->A substitution will be analyzed.
 - iCLIP: The 1st nucleotide of each read will be analyzed.

*Remove PCR duplicate*

 Look for a representative reads for all the reads which have the same genomic starting location. Two methods are provided:
  - Remove by starting location: A represent read will be selected from a bunch of reads with the same start location.
  - Remove by sequence: A represent read will be selected from a bunch of reads with exactly the same sequence.

*Shortest matched segment length*

This length is the sum of perfectly matched nucleotides number and insertion number. Reads whose matched segment length less than threshold will not be included in further analysis.


*Maximum mismatch number*

Although this can be set in mapping, here we still provide this filter in case users want to try more stringent criteria than what they set in mapping.



*FDR*

There are two FDR thresholds for clusters and mutations selection respectively. Default for enriched clusters and reliable mutations is 0.05.


*Reference Annotations*

Organism for which to use as reference for annotation of mutations sites.


*Notes*

 Even if you select to remove PCR duplicates for iCLIP, the program will not do it.
